I have also been ranked as high as third in the nation. In my free time I enjoy playing Valorant way too much for my own good.</div>

In terms of coaching, I worked at multiple camps last year (including Nova!), worked with a bunch of mentorship programs, and coached kids both inside and outside of the Whitman team. I love working with younger debaters and helping people find their stride in debate, super excited to help you do that this summer!</div>
